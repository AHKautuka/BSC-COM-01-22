Solutions to the Lab Tasks (Exercises) thet have been assigned in COM221: Advanced Computer Programming, as completed by Andrew H Kautuka (BSC/COM/01/22).

Note that binary files are found in 'bin' subdirectories, and resource files are found in 'res' subdirectories.

Currently the Lab 5 source, resource and binary files are not in any sub directory (as the repository was previously meant for them only).
Lab 6 source and binary files are in the Lab-6-Tasks subdirectory.
